# Chat-App

Hello everyone,
One day, I decided to make a simple chat app and started to make it. I thought why not 
use AI to improve my codes. I started using AI to improve my codes, and it goes pretty good
but honestly AI can only improve your code to the specific level but the developer is only one who
can improve and make the code optimized to the highest possibility.
Hence, In my opinion, AI can be used to improve the code but not for the full development and the developer needs 
to make code optimized and smooth. 


Basic chat app and it's backend is completed. Changes will happen, if required.
